      <description>Casual fans may have a hard time telling these horror franchises about paranormal investigators apart, so we're spelling it out for you!</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world was a simpler place before Insidious and The Conjuring came along. It used to be relatively easy to tell the major horror movie franchises apart. Freddy killed you in your dreams, Jason killed you at summer camp, Michael Myers only attacked on Halloween and Chucky was a plastic doll so he really stood out in a lineup.
</p><p>But although hardcore horror fans know the Insidious and The Conjuring franchises intimately, and don’t need any sort of primer to keep them straight, casual fans sometimes run into problems. They’re two of the biggest horror movie franchises we have left and they have a heck of a lot in common.
</p><p>Don't believe us? Read the following description and tell us whether we’re describing the Insidious horror movie franchise, or the Conjuring horror movie franchise:

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With Anthem, BioWare is keen to avoid the problem many games have run into as of late, with the perception that, at launch, releases may be "incomplete."
</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.usgamer.net/articles/anthem-pax-west-interview-new-details-live-service" target="_blank">USGamer</a> during PAX West, Executive Producer Mark Darrah said he feels consumers will be getting "a good, valuable game" when Anthem launches. And while more content will naturally be added post-launch, Darrah promised there will be plenty to keep players going for the long haul right out of the gate.
</p><p>"You would be able to play for months and months. Even if we weren't then layering a live service on top of it," said Darrah of BioWare's launch day goals for Anthem. "So, I think it's an excellent value right off the start. You know, four Exosuits, a complete story. So, both I think it's a complete package but it's also the starting line of an experience as well."

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two notable Fortnite theories claim to predict the rest of the movement path for the mysterious cube that randomly appeared in-game 11 days ago.
</p><p>The cube has been on the move since it <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/08/24/fortnite-cube-appears-in-game-could-be-teasing-next-major-event">first zapped into the desert biome</a>, and its slow migration sees it turn on one side every so often. At one point the cube moved every hour and 43 minutes but now its movements are irregular. On two occasions, the <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/08/29/just-so-you-know-the-fortnite-cube-is-empty">cube left a mysterious rune in the ground</a> with a surrounding field of anti-gravity. A third rune is likely to appear today.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first official image of Brie Larson as Captain Marvel has been revealed.
</p><p>Revealed on <a href="https://ew.com/movies/2018/09/05/captain-marvel-ew-cover-brie-larson/" target="_blank">EW</a>'s new issue cover, the superhero's suit is familiar, but has been tweaked from the comics for its MCU debut:
</p><p><img alt="" src="https://imagesvc.timeincapp.com/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewedit.files.wordpress.com%2F2018%2F09%2Few-1527_1273787832783832.jpg&amp;w=1100&amp;q=85" />
</p><p>EW's report confirms that this is not a traditional origin story, beginning after Carol Danvers already has her powers, and has joined a Kree military team called Starforce. Taking place in the '90s, Samuel L. Jackson will play a younger Nick Fury, complete with both eyes and a desk job at S.H.I.E.L.D.

</p><p>The Season 13 premiere of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia marks a big change in the status quo for the gang - Dennis Reynolds has left to become a father in North Dakota, leaving a hole in Paddy's Pub that our characters (okay, mostly just Mac) are desperate to fill.

      <description>Although the game places heavy emphasis on survival, there will still be a main story - with a nuclear conclusion.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bethesda has revealed a few more details about Fallout 76's campaign, including how finishing it will reward the player.
</p><p>Although the game will place a heavy emphasis on multiplayer opportunities and survival - when announced, Bethesda referred to it as an <a href="http://uk.ign.com/articles/2018/05/30/fallout-76-announced">"online survival RPG"</a> - that doesn't mean that it's giving up the series' traditional story-based elements, with the game's development team clarifying that Fallout 76 is still "driven by quests".
</p><p>The news comes from <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2018/09/04/the-new-wasteland-what-to-expect-from-fallout-76">Game Informer's</a> latest feature on the game, with the developers revealing that the game's "main quest" storyline will revolve around the mysterious disappearance of Vault 76's Overseer. Bethesda's director Todd Howard explains that "she left before everybody", leaving behind secret instructions for the player, who receives a transmission from her upon leaving the Vault. This transmission, and the instructions left behind, will drive the player through the game's main storyline - which will end with the player gaining access to the game's nukes.
